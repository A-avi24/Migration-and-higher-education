# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project explores the journey of international students — from enrollment, to job placement and visa outcomes — using SQL-based data analysis. By analyzing structured student data across multiple dimensions (country, university, course, scholarship, visa, and salary) we help the international education consultancy company to provide students with data driven insights and choices.
